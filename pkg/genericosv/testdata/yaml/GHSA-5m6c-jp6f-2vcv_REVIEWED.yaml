summary: Open Redirect in OAuth2 Proxy in github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy
description: |-
    ### Impact As users can provide a redirect address for the proxy to send the
    authenticated user to at the end of the authentication flow. This is expected to
    be the original URL that the user was trying to access. This redirect URL is
    checked within the proxy and validated before redirecting the user to prevent
    malicious actors providing redirects to potentially harmful sites.
