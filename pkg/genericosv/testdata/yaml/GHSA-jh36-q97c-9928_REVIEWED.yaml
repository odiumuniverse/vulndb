summary: Kubernetes vulnerable to validation bypass in k8s.io/kubernetes
description: |-
    Users may have access to secure endpoints in the control plane network.
    Kubernetes clusters are only affected if an untrusted user can modify Node
    objects and send proxy requests to them. Kubernetes supports node proxying,
    which allows clients of kube-apiserver to access endpoints of a Kubelet to
    establish connections to Pods, retrieve container logs, and more. While
    Kubernetes already validates the proxying address for Nodes, a bug in
    kube-apiserver made it possible to bypass this validation. Bypassing this
    validation could allow authenticated requests destined for Nodes to to the API
    server's private network.
