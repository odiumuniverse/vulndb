summary: Grafana vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting in github.com/grafana/grafana
description: |-
    Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Starting
    with the 8.1 branch, Grafana had a stored XSS vulnerability affecting the core
    plugin GeoMap. The stored XSS vulnerability was possible due to map attributions
    weren't properly sanitized and allowed arbitrary JavaScript to be executed in
    the context of the currently authorized user of the Grafana instance. An
    attacker needs to have the Editor role in order to change a panel to include a
    map attribution containing JavaScript. This means that vertical privilege
    escalation is possible, where a user with Editor role can change to a known
    password for a user having Admin role if the user with Admin role executes
    malicious JavaScript viewing a dashboard. Users may upgrade to version 8.5.21,
    9.2.13 and 9.3.8 to receive a fix.
