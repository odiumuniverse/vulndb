summary: pomerium_signature is not verified in middleware in github.com/pomerium/pomerium
description: |-
    ### Impact Some API endpoints under /.pomerium/ do not verify parameters with
    pomerium_signature. This could allow modifying parameters intended to be trusted
    to Pomerium.

    The issue mainly affects routes responsible for sign in/out, but does not
    introduce an authentication bypass.
